/// An arena is a location in memory where a group of terms with several properties is stored. Most
/// importantly, it ensures that all terms living in the arena are syntactically unique, which
/// accelerates many algorithms. In particular, this property allows for *memoizing* easily
/// operations on terms like substitution, shifting, type checking, etc. It also facilitates the
/// [building of terms](super::builders) which are named or use named terms.
///
/// This paradigm of memory management is akin to what is usually lectured for Binary Decision
/// Diagrams (BDD) management. Additionally, it makes use of Rust features to provide a clean
/// interface: the arena type is invariant over its lifetime argument (usually called `'arena`),
/// which together with the [`use_arena`] function, enforces strong guarantees on how the arena can
/// be used, particularly if several of them are used simultaneously.
///
/// Early versions of this system are freely inspired by an assignment designed by
/// [Jacques-Henri Jourdan](<https://jhjourdan.mketjh.fr>).
